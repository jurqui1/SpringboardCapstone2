Using Quantopians tools to balance a portfolio and perform risk management for maximum potential profits at a low risk using machine learning algorithms. 

The machine learning model found here is heavily based on the Qunatopian tutorial on machine learning, but is altered significantly to produce a strong trading alogrithm.

Initially, it will just be a python notebook with a few machine learning predictions and some analysis of what the best model prodcued and will be evolving into a fully functional alogrithm that can be used outside of the research portion of the Quantopian API.

The results of my algorithm will be posted here in the form of a tearsheet.
